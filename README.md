# trpd

Debugging is hard, using a debugger is simple. But if you don't want to inspect variable values, inspect core dumps, check the behaviour across multpile goroutines, change breakpoints while running the program, step through the code while it's running and watching the variable change, change values, disassemble the program, or do anything else a debugger does, then `trpd` might be the tool for you, you tool.
